	abstract = {Aim To detect centres of vascular plant endemism at a continental scale by analysis of specimen-based distributional data and to relate any pattern to environmental factors and history. Location Australia. Methods Presence of 8468 seed plant species-level taxa throughout continental Australia and Tasmania was mapped on a 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid to visualize the pattern of species richness. This sample comprises half the known flora. Three indices of endemism were calculated but we preferred one that is unrelated to species richness, so that these two concepts could be distinguished in practice. Centres of endemism were detected by simple mapping and by spatial autocorrelation analysis (SAC). Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of the patterns of species richness and endemism to latitude, topography and climate. Results Both species richness and endemism vary greatly across the continent but in most cases the same centres were high in both richness and endemism. Twelve distinct centres were identified. The major centres of both diversity and endemism are south-west western Australia, the Border Ranges between New South Wales and Queensland, the Wet Tropics near Cairns, Tasmania and the Iron-McIlwraith Range of eastern Cape York Peninsula. The last centre appears to be more significant than recognized by past authors. Whether this is a true Australian centre of endemism, or is largely an outlier of the flora of Papua New Guinea, is explored. Another centre, in the Adelaide--Kangaroo Island region, has been overlooked altogether by previous authors. Regression analysis did not find a simple climatic explanation of the observed patterns. There was a suggestion that topographic variation within the 1$\,^{\circ}$ cells may be positively correlated with endemism, which is consistent with mountainous regions functioning as refugia. One clear result is that all the major centres of endemism are near-coastal. A likely explanation is that Pleistocene expansions of the central desert have been a powerful limitation on the viability of refugia for narrowly endemic species. All the centres of endemism lie outside the estimated limits of the expanded arid zone at the last glacial maximum (18,000 yr BP). In particular, the `Central Australian Mountain Ranges centre of plant diversity and endemism' of Boden \& Given (1995) is detected as a strong centre of species richness, but not at all as a centre of endemism. This is despite good sampling of this region. Main conclusions Endemism can be distinguished from species richness by using an appropriate index and mapping of such indices can detect centres of endemism. This study demonstrates the value of specimen based distributional data, such as is held in state herbaria and museums.},

    abstract = { There are three major difficulties encountered by those dealing with the phenomenon of endemism: a semantic problem, the absence of a clear conceptual framework, and an analytical problem. First, the terms endemic and endemism are used in the literature in unclear or contradictory ways. Often neither the title nor the abstract of an article makes the meaning clear. Following the usage that tends to prevail among Anglo-American zoogeographers, a species or other taxon is regarded here as endemic to an area if it occurs only in that area. To speak of a taxon as endemic in this context without specifying an area is meaningless. Since geographic ranges of taxa change with time, time must also be specified, or at least understood. Second, a conceptual model is provided in which only changes in ranges (occuring frequently) and speciation (occuring relatively rarely) are seen to change the percentage of endemism in any given area. At a subsidiary level, many complex factors influence areographic changes and speciation. Among the more important of these are: distance from source to target area, size of area, geological age of area, time since isolation, environemntal variety and stability, and vagility and ecological tolerance of organisms being considered. These are not all independent factors. This complexity leads to the third and still largely unresolved problem namely how to analyse a global biological system involving processes on both a shorter-term ecological time scale and a longer-term evolutionary time scale. }

abstract = {Summary The concept of endemism is useful in quantifying the biological uniqueness of an area, and has been used by many authors as a meaningful alternative to simple species richness. The traditional definition of endemism includes those species with ranges restricted to a particular region, and therefore is useful only in reference to that region. To compare different regions, however, a standardized approach is required, so several authors began using area-based definitions. Accordingly, those species with ranges smaller than a particular area (e.g. 50,000 km 2) are deemed endemic. Nevertheless, several problems are associated with this approach: as the area threshold changes, scaling of endemism also changes, producing a different picture of endemism for each spatial scale. Moreover, the areal definition assumes equal levels of heterogeneity in different landscapes (clearly a simplification), which overemphasizes fine-grained regions. Herein, the importance of distinguishing the regional definition (endemism) from the areal definition (range restriction) is emphasized, and investigators are encouraged to consider multiple spatial scales and geographic dimensions in evaluations of biodiversity.},
