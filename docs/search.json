    "text": "Invertebrates are an often overlooked but vital component of healthy ecosystems. They perform a variety of critical ecological functions and ecosystem services, including pollination, soil modification, organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling, and food provisioning to other animals and humans Lavelle et al. (2006), MACADAM and STOCKAN (2015), Griffiths et al. (2021), porto21. They are ubiquitous across land and seascapes, constituting the vast majority of Earth’s biodiversity. Over 1.25 million invertebrate species have been documented, representing around 95% of animal species Eisenhauer and Hines (2021). However, many invertebrate species and populations around the globe are under threat, as are the services they provide and the ecosystems they support ().\nThey are threatened by… Conservation actions such as… can help to mitigate these effects, protect and restore biodiversity, and prevent extinctions.\nBiological conservation is hampered by limited resources, and identifying priority areas to focus conservation efforts can help to maximise their effectiveness Myers et al. (2000). Species richness and endemism are key indices of biodiversity that reflect biological complexity and uniqueness, and can be used to identify ‘biodiversity hotspots’ to prioritise for conservation Myers (1988)@, caldecott96, Reid (1998). Species richness refers to the number of species in an area. Numerous definitions of endemism exist but generally a taxon is considered endemic to a particular area if it occurs only in that area Anderson (1994). By these definitions, species richness and endemism are dependent on the specification of area Townsend Peterson and Watson (1998). Quantifying endemism and identifying areas of high endemism is important in conservation because narrowly endemic taxa have small ranges by definition and are therefore more vulnerable to threats such as environmental change and habitat loss (). Identifying hotspots helps to focus limited resources and improve the efficiency of biodiversity conservation efforts.\nIdentifying hotspots for all invertebrates is not logistically feasible at present, so as a proof of concept we focussed on spiders in the infraorder Mygalomorphae, using spatial analyses to identify hotspots of species richness and endemism across Australia… Our methods can be applied to other taxonomic groups… Quantification of endemism depends on the spatial scale being considered, and numerous calculation methods exist (). Endemism can be quantified on a continuous scale across a spatial grid with reference to the constituent grid cells, based on how many cells taxa occupy.\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, Sydney. 1994. “Area and Endemism.” The Quarterly Review of Biology 69 (4): 451–71. https://doi.org/10.1086/418743.\n\n\nEisenhauer, Nico, and Jes Hines. 2021. “Invertebrate Biodiversity and Conservation.” Current Biology 31 (19): R1214–18.\n\n\nGriffiths, Hannah M., Louise A.
