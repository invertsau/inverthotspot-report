Biodiversity 'hotspots' - species richness and endemism... A taxon is endemic to a particular area if it occurs only in that area (). Quantification of endemism depends on the spatial scale being considered, and numerous calculation methods exist (). Quantifying endemism and identifying areas of high endemism is important in conservation because narrowly endemic taxa have small ranges by definition and are therefore more vulnerable to threats such as environmental change and habitat loss ().

Identifying hotspots for all invertebrates is not logistically feasible at present, so as a proof of concept we focussed on spiders in the infraorder Mygalomorphae, using spatial analyses to identify hotspots of species richness and endemism across Australia... Our methods can be applied to other taxonomic groups...
